# Gesture-controlled-game
Play a simple game by using gestures

Python libraries used:
<ul>
  <li>MediaPipe</li>
  <li>Open CV</li>
  <li>Pyautogui</li>
</ul>

Game built by a friend of mine.

<h3>How to play:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Install the libraries by using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`</li>
  <li>Make sure you have python version between 3.7 to 3.10 (preferably 3.10), since mediapipe library is not supported in other versions</li>
  <li>Run the `test.py` file, and then launch the game `game.exe`</li>
  <li>First make sure to make this gesture with your fingers. Only when the hand is in this gesture, will the program detect and execute movements.
